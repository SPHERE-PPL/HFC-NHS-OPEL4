# SPHERE-PPL Health Forecasting Contest - NHS OPEL 4 Predictions

## Introduction[^readme-1]

[^readme-1]: Adapted from NHS England Website (<https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/integrated-opel-framework-2024-to-2026/>)

NHS England introduced the national Operational pressure escalation Level (OPEL) framework in 2016 to standardise local and system escalation processes, encourage wider co-operation and improve regional and national oversight of operational pressure.

Measurement of operational pressures was further standardised for 2023/24 with the introduction of 9 acute hospital parameters. This approach provided greater consistency and objectivity but remained limited by its focus on NHS acute providers and their contribution to integrated care system (ICS) operational pressure. It was intended as an iterative step toward a clinically relevant, objective and digitally enabled framework to monitor operational pressure.

The integrated OPEL framework 2024 to 2026 now provides a unified, systematic and structured approach for a coordinated response to operational pressures at system, regional and national levels, one that has been expanded to the contribution of community, mental health and NHS 111 services to ICS pressures.

| **(Normalised) OPEL score** | **Corresponding escalation level** | **Clinical risk** |
|----|----|----|
| 0–15 | OPEL 1 | Low |
| \>15–40 | OPEL 2 | Medium |
| \>40–70 | OPEL 3 | High |
| \>70–100 | OPEL 4 | Very high |
